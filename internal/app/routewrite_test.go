// that the stored watermark stays put — true, the write is atomic — and that a
// restart therefore replays. What it missed is the running process: settle had
// already removed those seqs from `inflight` and advanced `confirmed`, so the
// NEXT successful flush computed its mark from an inflight they were no longer
// in and wrote a watermark above a batch whose deliveries were never written.
