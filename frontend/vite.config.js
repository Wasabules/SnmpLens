 * Reload the page when the generated Wails bindings change.

 * `wails dev` regenerates frontend/wailsjs whenever a Go method is added or its
 * signature changes. That is a change to the module's EXPORTS, which hot module
 * replacement cannot patch — the page keeps the version it imported and fails
 * with "does not provide an export named X", which reads like a missing method
 * rather than a stale tab. A full reload is the correct response, and the only
 * one that leaves the running page agreeing with the running backend.
