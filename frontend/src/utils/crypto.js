 * Sealing the credentials kept in localStorage.
 *
 * This file used to generate an AES-256-GCM key, export it as an EXTRACTABLE
 * JWK, and write it to the SAME localStorage as the ciphertext it protected.
 * Anyone who could read the WebView2 Local Storage folder had both, so the
 * encryption kept a credential out of a casual glance at the file and out of
 * nothing else.
 *
 * The key now lives in the OS credential store (pkg/secrets: DPAPI on Windows,
 * the Keychain on macOS, a 0600 file in a 0700 directory elsewhere) and the
 * renderer never holds it. The values stay here, sealed, in the same `enc:` +
 * base64(12-byte IV || GCM output) format as before — which is why an existing
 * user's blob keeps opening after the key moves, with nothing re-encrypted.
 *
 * What this does NOT do: the plaintext still lives in this process's memory
 * while the app runs, because every request builder reads it from the settings
 * store. Moving that too means the Go side resolving credentials by profile,
 * which is a different and much larger change. The banner in settings says so
 * rather than implying more.
