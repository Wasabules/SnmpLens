// Turn a directory's load results into the question people actually ask.
//
// The per-file list answers "did this file load". The question in front of
// someone with a folder of vendor MIBs is the other one: WHICH MODULES ARE
// MISSING, and who needs them. Those are the same facts, rolled the other way
// — one row per absent module instead of one row per broken file — and the
// difference matters because a single missing `VENDOR-SMI` fails twelve files
// and reads as twelve unrelated problems.
//
// This is pure, and deliberately so. It rolls up what LoadMibsWithDiagnostics
// ALREADY returns: nothing here calls the bridge, and in particular nothing
// runs Diagnose per file. Diagnose re-reads and re-parses, and it takes
// pkg/mib's package-level EXCLUSIVE gosmi mutex — a sweep of a 400-file
// directory to draw a panel would stop every OID translation in every other
// tab while it ran.
//
// What that costs, stated rather than hidden: the Go side diagnoses FAILURES
// only, so the imports of a file that loaded fine are not in this data. This
// answers "what is missing", not "what depends on what". The second question
// needs a different source and is not worth an exclusive lock to draw.
