/**
 * The scene catalogue: one entry per screenshot the site needs, in BOTH themes.
 *
 * A scene is a URL, not a script. `?scene=monitor-charts-dark` seeds
 * localStorage before the bundle evaluates, picks the tab, and may override any
 * bridge fixture — so a capture is a plain page load with nothing to click and
 * nothing to time.
 *
 * That matters more than it sounds. Driving a UI by clicking is how screenshot
 * automation becomes flaky: a selector moves, a transition is half-finished, and
 * the image is wrong in a way nobody notices until it is on the front page.
 * Here the only thing that can vary between two runs of the same scene is the
 * clock, and the fixtures pin that too.
 *
 * Every entry is declared ONCE and emitted twice, dark and light. The site shows
 * whichever matches the reader's own theme, so a missing counterpart is not a
 * missing picture — it is a picture of the wrong application on half the screens
 * that load the page. Declaring the pair by hand is how one of the two silently
 * drifts from the other.
