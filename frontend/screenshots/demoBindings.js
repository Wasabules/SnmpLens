/**
 * What the browser demo's simulator answers.
 *
 * The demo has no backend, and a binding no scene answers falls through to the
 * generated fixture — which answers a List… call with an empty array. So the
 * simulator dialog offered no model to make a device from and listed no device.
 *
 * The answers are the screenshot scenes' own, not written a second time: the
 * catalogue and the bench of the "simulator" scene, the lab switch of the
 * "simulator-data" one, the custom model's icon and the suggested address of the
 * editor's. vite.demo.config.js takes the opening state from the catalogue for
 * the same reason — the demo and the pictures of it cannot drift apart.
 *
 * What a simulated device DOES stays refused (bridge/dynamic.js, DEMO_ONLY):
 * starting one opens a UDP socket, and a web page has none to open.
