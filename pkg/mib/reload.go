// gosmi keeps its whole world in package-level state: one search path, one
// module table, one node index. Every exported call here reaches into it.
//
// Wails dispatches each bound method on its own goroutine, so a batch
// ResolveOids from the operations panel can already overlap a LoadAll from the
// MIB settings tab — a read racing a mutation of that shared table. The editor
// makes it far more likely, because saving a MIB tears the world down and
// rebuilds it while the rest of the app carries on resolving OIDs.
//
// One EXCLUSIVE mutex for the package, not an RWMutex.
//
// gosmi has no read-only operations. internal.(*Object).GetSmiNode is a
// getter that memoises: on first call it writes x.Oid and x.OidLen. Two
// goroutines holding a read lock and resolving the same OID therefore write
// the same fields at the same time — reproduced under -race with four
// concurrent Translate/ResolveOids/Table callers, which is exactly what the
// app does while a walk resolves names in several tabs.
//
// A shared lock would be correct only if reading were reading. Serialising is
// the price of a dependency whose accessors mutate; the lock is held for a
// batch rather than per OID, so a 300-varbind walk takes it once.
