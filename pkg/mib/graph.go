// What imports what: the dependency graph of a directory of MIB files.
//
// The per-file load list answers "did this load", and the roll in the settings
// panel answers "what is missing and who wants it". Neither answers the third
// question, which is the one somebody has in front of a folder from a vendor:
// what does THIS file need, and what does that need in turn.
//
// It is cheap, and that is why it can be offered at all. readImports reads the
// head of each file as TEXT and stops at the semicolon ending the IMPORTS
// clause — no parse, no gosmi, and therefore no exclusive lock. The cycle
// detector has been doing exactly this on every load with diagnostics; this
// exposes the same scan as an answer rather than as a side effect.

// GraphNode is one module and what it imports.

	// looks a module up BY FILE NAME, and a file whose name does not match what
	// it declares loads fine and is invisible to everything that imports it.
	File    string   `json:"file"`
	Imports []string `json:"imports"`
	// Present is whether a file for this module exists in the directory at all.
	// A module that is only ever imported and never found is the interesting
	// row: it is what somebody has to go and download.
	Present bool `json:"present"`
	// Loaded is whether gosmi has it right now. Present and not loaded usually
	// means the operator switched it off, which needs a checkbox rather than a
	// download — the same distinction the missing-import roll makes.
	Loaded bool `json:"loaded"`
	// ImportedBy is the edge read the other way, so the interface can answer
	// both questions from one structure.

// ModuleGraph scans every MIB file in the service's directory and reports what
// each one imports.
//
// A module named in an IMPORTS clause with no file behind it is included as a
// node with Present false: leaving it out would draw a tree whose branches stop
// without saying why, which is the opposite of what this is for.
//
// The lock is taken only for the gosmi.IsLoaded calls at the end. Reading the
// files does not need it, and holding it across a four-hundred-file directory
// scan would stop every OID translation in every other tab for the duration.
