// The trap listener's lifecycle.
//
// `Client.trapListener` is written by StartTrapListener on the caller's
// goroutine, written to nil by the listener goroutine when Listen returns, and
// read by StopTrapListener. Nothing guarded it, so the three race — reproducibly
// under -race, and visibly even without: a Start immediately following a Stop
// could be refused because the previous listener had not cleared itself yet, or
// could clobber a listener that was still running.
//
// This matters more now than it did: shutdown has to stop the listener, so the
// stop path is about to be exercised at exactly the moment everything else is
// being torn down.
