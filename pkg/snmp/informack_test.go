// An INFORM must not be acknowledged unless it was durably journalled.

// The synchronous insert on the receive loop exists for exactly this reason:
// gosnmp sends the acknowledgement after OnNewTrap returns, so acknowledging
// before the write would be a lie. When the write FAILED, the acknowledgement
// went out anyway — the same lie told at the one moment it matters, and the
// sender then has no reason to retry.
//
// Driven end to end, sender to listener over a real socket, because the
// property only exists at that layer: the suppression works by changing the
// PDU type gosnmp reads after the handler returns, and only a real sender can
// say whether an acknowledgement arrived.
