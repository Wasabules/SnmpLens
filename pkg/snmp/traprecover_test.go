// handleTrap emits every received trap to the webview when it has one, and the
// Wails runtime answers a context it did not issue by ENDING THE PROCESS —
// which under test looks like a trap that was never handled, or an INFORM that
// was never acknowledged, i.e. exactly the results these tests assert. The
// guarded branch in handleTrap is `if c.ctx != nil`, so the field has to be
// nil, not a background context.
//
// Assigned rather than passed, because staticcheck refuses a literal nil
// Context (SA1012) and it is right to: the reason this one is nil is a
// property of the code under test, and it belongs in a comment rather than in
// eight call sites.

// DECODER and none around OnNewTrap, so an unguarded panic here unwinds
// through listenUDP and ends the process — taking every monitoring session,
// every threshold and the outbox drain with it, from a UDP packet nobody
// authenticated.
//
// Measured with a probe before the guard existed: unguarded, the process died
// with "exit status 2" and never received the second trap; guarded, it
// recovered and handled it.
