// What the trap path can actually take, measured as LOSS at a stated offered
// rate rather than as one over a mean service time.
//
// The two are not the same: offering at 1/mean is a utilisation of 1.0 by
// definition, where a queue is already unstable. Quoting "1035 traps/s" from a
// 0.97 ms mean was the wrong claim, and this test exists so the number that gets
// quoted is one that was observed.
//
// Measured here, end to end, with the read buffer raised and routing off the
// receive loop:
//
//	  200/s x   500 ....... 100%
//	  600/s x   500 ....... 100%
//	  900/s x   500 ....... 100%
//	 2000/s x  4000 ....... 100%
//	 5000/s x 10000 ....... 93%   <- first loss
//
// Note the shape: rate alone decides nothing any more. A burst that fits the
// socket buffer is absorbed whatever rate it arrives at, so what costs
// datagrams is sustained overload for longer than the buffer covers.

// offerTraps sends n datagrams at a target rate and reports how many the
// application journalled.
